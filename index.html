    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

                    <p>Just copied from  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_myfirst" target="blank">W3Schools / My First JS</a> for fun. Nothing to do with the Discover course. No idea of what or how JS makes it happen, but one day I will.</p>
                    <p>
                        Let' make a guess. Since there's no <q>script</q> written here in the code and the <code>getElementById</code> stuff calls a certain <code>innerHTML</code>, the script itself must be part of the <cite>HTML</cite>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Useful, but no big deal.</p>
                    <p>I've applied some CSS to the button and its surroundings.Also I added text to the line where the time and date will be displayed.</p>

                    <p style="color: white;">Ricardo Barros Becheli, lunch time, Three Kings Day, 2022</p>

                    <button type="button"
                    onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
                    Click me to display Date and Time.</button>

    <div class="intro">

    <h1>Hello, Discover! This is a "h1" heading</h1>
    <h2>Deploying new habilities (and this is "h2")</h2>
            <p>
        When you want to enphasize something just open a em tag, like that: <em>italic it makes</em> and no more than that. But if you want to make it bold, just appy the strong tag <strong>like that</strong> and the text will obbey.</p>
            <p>Wunderbar!</p>
            <p>
            And
            no matter
            how
            many "enters"
            you
            press nor spaces you       give (like
            I'm
            doing
             now
             in
             the
             source code),
             no paragraph will be created by the "enters",
             and no more than one space       will be placed between two words.
            </p>
        

            <p>
        Should you want a new paragraph you have to place a "p" tag just as I did now.
            </p>
        
            <p>And         <br>with a (br) <br>tag <br>you break <br> lines even if <br> in the code all appears <br> in one single line.
            </p>
        
            <p>
        Allright. Since we made that clear let's start talking about adding spaces.
            </p>

    <h2>
        About adding spaces, we have the following from C3Schools : (and here is another h2)
    </h2>    
        

        <blockquote>
            <p>
            "A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space, made by this code without opening or closing tags: <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> and all the following spaces area made like that.
            A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-breaking &nbsp;&nbsp;space is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a space &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will not break into a new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line. (a line break here) <br>
            Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive. Let's put an example here in a line just to check if, when shortening the browser width, the <q>10 km/h</q> will stay together, like now: 10&nbsp;km/h and 10&nbsp;km/h and10&nbsp;km/h. Enough?
            Examples:
            </p>
            <p>
                ยง&nbsp;10
            </p>
            <p>10&nbsp;km/h</p>
            <p>10&nbsp;PM</p>
        </blockquote>



            <p>
        I must confess that I had a hard time trying to show here the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> code instead of it just being an invisible code and a visible space. Stackoverflow website helped me on that. Thanks!
            </p>
            
        <div class="well">
            <p>
                Well, as you can see I didn't wait.
            </p>    
            <p>Just put some CSS in a separate document that is called by the <q>link rel</q> above, in the head area (it's in the source code, of course).</p> 
                
            <p>This reflects what I know so far, as of the first week of 2022. Should I learn more, and of course I will, I'll leave this stage here as it is and copy/paste everything below a certain point and make the new look.
               </p>
                
            <p>It really shouldn't be necessary because it's all in the Git/Github history, but I want to make sure the visual change gets very clear and visible right here to the user.

    <h1>Summary of what has been taught so far <i>(this is h1)</i> </h1>
    
    <h2>Before I started coding this HTML page a few things had been taught: <i>(this is h2)</i></h2>
    <h3>And I went back to earlier lessons so nothing passes without consulting W3Schoolsand MDN <i>(and here's h3)</i></h3>
        
    
            <p>
        These lines here look confused, very confused. <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">That THAT'S BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MaNY "ENTERS" YOU PReSS IN html NO PARAGRAPHs ARE CREATED UNLESS YOU INSERT THE TEXT IN A</span> <CODE>&LT;P&GT;</CODE> tag. In the frame below I will turn part of this text into a list oj what we will learn, STARTING HERE:
        Comments
        TAGS - Opening and closing 
        Emmet abbreviation (typing assistance included in the Visual Studio Code editor)
        Title hierarchy tags (h1, h2, etc)
        Paragraph tags (p)
        Element - The tag opening and closing plus its content make an element.
        Empty elements like <q>img</q> and <q>input</q>, that have no closing. 
        <q>They have no content, only attributes. (Mike) </q>
        Attributes work either as extra info and/or configurations. In the case of the img tag they are configurations.
        Anatomy of an attribute: After the name of the tag there's a space, then the name of the attribute followed by  an equal sign and double quotes containing the attribute itself.
        Attributes can also be boolean, like true, false, disabled.
        Quotes - Double x Single - Using double quotes in attributes is better than the single ones because the last ones can be confused with English grammar signs, like <q>I'm</q> or <q>There's</q>, for instance. Note that Emmet itself provides us always with double quotes. This is one of the good practices in coding.
        Quotes - Omiting - Some attributes can work without quotes, like in the <q>a</q> tag: The hypertext will work without being between quotes, but it's not a good practice because if you add another attribute (like <q>target</q>, for instance) immediately following the unquoted hyperlink there can be a big conflict of interpretation depending on the user's browser.

    <h2>Double x Single quotes</h2>
    <p>
         Using double quotes in attributes is better than the single ones because the last ones can be confused with English grammar signs, like <q>I'm</q> or <q>There's</q>, for instance. Note that Emmet itself provides us always with double quotes. This is one of the good practices in coding.

<h2>Quotes - Omiting</h2>

                    <p>In a good example of blockquote everything in a block - you could say a whole paragraph or a long text - must be inside the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag. It indents the block and indicates that an external text was cited. A good way to complement that is adding an information about the origin of the citation. This info <u>does not appear</u> in the HTML page, only in the code. The information will be done by an <strong><u>attribute</u></strong> called "<u>cite</u>" inside the blockquote opening tag (like we do with the <em>inline style</em>) and it's not to be confused with the <strong><u>element</u></strong> <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> of item 2 below.</p>

                    <p>Use CSS' (margin-left: 0;) to remove the indentation from the blockquote element.</p>

                    <p>HTML Blockquote is a DOM  Object. You can access a blockquote element by using getElementById(). Example:</p>
                    
                    <p>var x = document.getElementById("myBlockquote");</p>

                    <p>The Blockquote object also supports the standard properties and events.</p>

                <p>Good example of <cite>cite</cite> here. The HTML <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.)</p>

                <p><cite>Catcher in the Rye</cite> (this title is within a <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag) is a novel by Jerome David Salinger.</p>

                <figure style="background-color: rgb(54, 85, 85); padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px; margin-right: 600px; margin-left: 0%;">
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>It has a <code>cite</code> inside a <code style="background-color: black; color: rgb(255, 5, 180);">figcaption</code> and they are both inside a <code style="background-color: black; color: yellow;">&lt;figure&gt;</code> element. Note that the paragraph tag is surrounded by a <code style="background-color: black; color: red;">blockquote</code> element. And here's how the code stays:</p>

                <img src="images/snippet1.jpg" alt="Code snippet of the cite element.">

            <li style="padding-bottom: 55px;">
                <p>Good example of <q>q</q> (applyed here) <q>and here</q>:</p>
                    
                <p>Use <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> for <strong>inline</strong>, short quotations. <q><em>This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the &lt;blockquote&gt; element</em></q>. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q" target="blank" style="color: rgb(3, 192, 192);">MDN</a>
                </p>

                <p>Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation, like <q>now</q>. And is that it?</p>

                <p>No. This element may include global attributes. Therefore it can be combined with the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>, for instance.</p>
                
                <p>Again, note that the value of the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> attribute is a URL that <strong>designates a source</strong> document or message for the information quoted. This attribute is intended to point to information explaining the context or the reference for the quote. No more than that. </p>
                
                <p>I mean, no link is established. It's only an information that stays hidden from the user and works behind the scenes for SEO and other algorithm purposes.</p>

                <p>All this said, something like this can be built with <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> combined:</p>

                <p>And the code is written as follows (for "Displaying Code" in details, see next topic, but take a glimpse of this for while):</p>

                <p>The HTML <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.</p>
                <p>The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.</p>
                <p>The text in the &lt;address&gt; element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the &lt;address&gt; element.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>

                <p>The <code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code> (short for bidirectional override) tag is used to override the current text direction.

                    You must specify the <code>"dir"</code> attribute on this element. This mandatory attribute specifies the base direction of the element's text content, which overrides the inherent directionality of characters as defined in [UNICODE].</p>
                    
                <p>Attributes: This element contains dir attributes which are used to specify the direction of text written inside the <code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code> element. The dir attribute contains two values which are listed below:</p> 
 
                    <ul>
                    <li><code>&lt;bdo dir="<abbr title="right to left">rtl</abbr>"&gt;</code>: The text direction from right to left (reverse the text).</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;bdo dir="<abbr title="left to right">ltr</abbr>"&gt;</code>: The text usual direction from left to right.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>The sequence "1-2-3-4-5" was reversed in this line by this set of tag & attribute as: <bdo dir="rtl">1-2-3-4-5</bdo>.</p>
            </li>
