    <h1>Hello, Discover! This is a "h1" heading</h1>
    <h2>Deploying new habilities (and this is "h2")</h2>
        <p>
        When you want to enphasize something just open a em tag, like that: <em>italic it makes</em> and no more than that. But if you want to make it bold, just appy the strong tag <strong>like that</strong> and the text will obbey. Wunderbar!And
        no matter
        how     
        many "enters"
        you
        press nor spaces you       give (like 
        I'm 
        doing
         now 
         in 
         the 
         source code), 
         no paragraph will be created by the "enters", 
         and no more than one space       will be placed between two words.
        </p>

        <p>
        Should you want a new paragraph you have to place a "p" tag just as I did now.
        </p>
        
        <p>And         <br>with a (br) <br>tag <br>you break <br> lines even if <br> in the code all appears <br> in one single line.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Allright. Since we made that clear let's start talking about adding spaces.
        </p>

    <H2>
        About adding spaces, we have the following from C3Schools : (and here is another h2)

    <p>QUOTE</p>

        "A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;

        A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-breaking &nbsp;&nbsp;space is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a space &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will not break into a new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line. (a line break here) <br>

        Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive. Let's put an example here in a line just to check if, when shortening the browser width, the <q>10 km/h</q> will stay together, like now: 10&nbsp;km/h and 10&nbsp;km/h and10&nbsp;km/h. Enough?

        Examples:


        </p>
        <p>
            §&nbsp;10


        </p>

        <p>10&nbsp;km/h</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;PM</p>

        I must confess that I'm itching to get started with CSS to put an order in this page, but wait we must if in me you trust.

        This lines here below (that was built formerly as a paragraph, as you may check in GIT/GITHUB's history) will turn into a list when it's time.
        Comments
        TAGS - Opening and closing 
        Emmet abbreviation (typing assistance included in the Visual Studio Code editor)
        Title hierarchy tags (h1, h2, etc)
        Paragraph tags (p)
        Element - The tag opening and closing plus its content make an element.
        Empty elements like <q>img</q> and <q>input</q>, that have no closing. 
        <q>They have no content, only attributes. (Mike) </q>
        Attributes work either as extra info and/or configurations. In the case of the img tag they are configurations.
        Anatomy of an attribute: After the name of the tag there's a space, then the name of the attribute followed by  an equal sign and double quotes containing the attribute itself.
        Attributes can also be boolean, like true, false, disabled.
        Quotes - Double x Single - Using double quotes in attributes is better than the single ones because the last ones can be confused with English grammar signs, like <q>I'm</q> or <q>There's</q>, for instance. Note that Emmet itself provides us always with double quotes. This is one of the good practices in coding.
        Quotes - Omiting - Some attributes can work without quotes, like in the <q>a</q> tag: The hypertext will work without being between quotes, but it's not a good practice because if you add aniother attribute (like <q>target</q>, for instance) immediately following the unquoted hyperlink there can be a big conflict of interpretation depending on the user's browser.

        <p>
           Tags are part of an HTML element.  
        </p>
        <p>According to W3Schools they <i>START</i>  and <i>END</i>  an element.

        </p>
        <p>According to MDN they <i>OPEN</i> and <i>CLOSE</i> an element.
