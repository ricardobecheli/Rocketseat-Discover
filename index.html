    <h1>Hello, Discover! This is a "h1" heading</h1>
    <h2>Deploying new habilities (and this is "h2")</h2>
        <p>
        When you want to enphasize something just open a em tab, like that: <em>italic it makes</em> and no more than that. But if you want to make it bold, just appy the strong tab <strong>like that</strong> and the text will obbey. Wunderbar!And
        no matter
        how     
        many "enters"
        you
        press nor spaces you       give (like 
        I'm 
        doing
         now 
         in 
         the 
         source code), 
         no paragraph will be created by the "enters", 
         and no more than one space       will be placed between two words.
        </p>

        <p>
        Should you want a new paragraph you have to place a "p" tag just as I did now.
        </p>
        
        <p>And         <br>with a (br) <br>tag <br>you break <br> lines even if <br> in the code all appears <br> in one single line.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Allright. Since we made that clear let's start talking about adding spaces.

    <H2>
        About adding spaces, we have the following from C3Schools : (and here is another h2)

        "A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;

        A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-breaking &nbsp;&nbsp;space is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a space &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will not break into a new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line. (a line break here) <br>

        Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive. Let's put an example here in a line just to check if, when shortening the browser width, the <q>10 km/h</q> will stay together, like now: 10&nbsp;km/h and 10&nbsp;km/h and10&nbsp;km/h. Enough?

        Examples:


        </p>
        <p>
            ยง&nbsp;10


        </p>

        <p>10&nbsp;km/h</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;PM</p>
